# Cisco ACI CLI

Useful CLI commands to run from the APIC or leafs to glean information around the configurational and operational state of the fabric. 

> NOTE: The emulated NXOS running on the APIC can be used for confiugration purposes, though due to the complex underlying obect model it's easy to get in a muddle! My advice, stick to the GUI for configuration until you're ready to use the API!

### APIC CLI Commands

All run directly from the APIC CLI which requires a user to have a minimum of **admin/read-all** for their role/permissions.

> Note the APIC CLI is emulated NXOS so many commands blah. It is also perfectly possible to configure ACI using the APCI CLI though this guide is focussed on information gathering and troubleshooting commands.
