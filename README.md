# Cisco ACI CLI

### Cisco Docs

Let's start with some Cisco docs.Â 

[**Troubleshooting Commands run from the APIC**](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-apic/214132-cli-commands-used-to-troubleshoot-aci-fa.html)

[**ACI CLI Cheat Sheet (from the Cisco Community)**](https://community.cisco.com/t5/data-center-and-cloud-knowledge-base/cisco-aci-cli-commands-quot-cheat-sheet-quot/ta-p/3145799)

> **There will be overlap with these in the following sections, but I aim to summarise the commands I use most with additional information and explanations.**

### APIC CLI Commands

All run directly from the APIC CLI which requires a user to have a minimum of **admin/read-all** for their role/permissions.

> Note the APIC CLI is emulated NXOS so many commands blah. It is also perfectly possible to configure ACI using the APCI CLI though this guide is focussed on information gathering and troubleshooting commands.
